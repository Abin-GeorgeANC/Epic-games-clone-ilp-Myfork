                           Epic will be offering a new free game available each week.
                           When you claim a free game, it’s yours to keep - even after
                           the game is no longer available to new customers for
                           free.<br />

                           why?</strong

                           Once you claim a free game, it’s yours to keep. If you come
                           back later and don’t see it in your account, please check to
                           see if you have multiple accounts. If you created an Epic
                           account using an @gmail.com email address, log in to it
                           directly using your Gmail password; using the Google login
                           button will create a distinct account even if it’s tied to
                           the same @gmail.com email address. And check to see if you
                           have both a console-linked account (logging in via
                           PlayStation, Xbox, or Nintendo account) and a separate Epic
                           account. If you still encounter issues, please contact

                           Some publishers occasionally offer demos or free trial
                           periods for certain non-free games from time to time (for
                           example, a Free Weekend trial). During a free trial period,
                           you can download and play a trial version of the game before
                           you decide to purchase, but you can no longer access the
                           game when the trial period ends.</span

                           The Epic Games Store is available to players in most
                           countries in the world except where prohibited by US law,
                           such as North Korea and Iran. Certain regions may have
                           additional legal requirements that developers may need to
                           implement in their games in order to be compliant and to be
                           distributed there.<br />

                           The Epic Games Store currently accepts 43 currencies (USD,
                           EUR, GBP, PLN, BRL, UAH, RUB, KRW, JPY, TRY, AUD, CAD, DKK,
                           NOK, SEK, CZK, ILS, CHF, MXN, PEN, HUF, CLP, SAR, AED, RON,
                           NZD, ZAR, INR, COP, CSC, UYU, HKD, IDR, MYR, PHP, SGD, THB,
                           VND, KZT, QAR, BGN, TWD, CNY). We’re working to bring more
                           currencies online.<br />
                           <br />
                           If your currency is not on the list, you’ll see the prices
                           displayed in US Dollars with the exception of Iceland which
                           will display Euros. You will still pay in your local
                           currency according to the current exchange rates. In some
                           countries paying in a different currency may incur
                           additional bank conversion fees. We are working on expanding
                           the list of supported currencies.</span
