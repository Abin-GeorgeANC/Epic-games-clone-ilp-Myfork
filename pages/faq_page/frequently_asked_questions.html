                        Exclusives are a part of the growth of many successful
                        platforms for games and for other forms of digital
                        entertainment, such as streaming video and music.</span

                        Epic works in partnership with developers and publishers
                        to offer games exclusively on the store. In exchange for
                        exclusivity, Epic provides them with financial support
                        for development and marketing, which enables them to
                        build more polished games with significantly less
                        uncertainty for the creators. In addition, creators will
                        earn 88% of all the revenue from their game
