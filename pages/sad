i have created a database in firestore
the function i need to do is to fetch data and post it in my html page
the flow is as follows
in firestore database a collection is created called users data and in that collection the details of the person who has logged in the application that is the email id associated is stored.
the array stores details such as display_name, email_id,first_name etc
from that i need to fetch data stored in a field called cart which is an array
in that array multiple maps can be created base on the number of games the users has added to his cart from that i need to fetch details from each map such as actualPrice, image , offerpercentage and title .
i need these data to be displayed on the sections,
